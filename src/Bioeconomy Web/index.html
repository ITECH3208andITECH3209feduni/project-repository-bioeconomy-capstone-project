                    <p>The Gippsland region organic waste mapping study (“the study”) was commissioned by Food & Fibre Gippsland (“F&FG”) on 22 July 2022 to establish the variety and scale of organic waste materials within this region as a baseline for developing
                        upcycling opportunities on an industrial scale.</p>
                    <p>The wider objective of the study is to explore the application of proven technology solutions in future projects that will have the ability to upcycle these materials and contribute to the region’s circular economy.</p>
                    <p>This study was managed by Food & Fibre Gippsland and contracted to Food Security Solutions Ltd (FSS) to conduct the research between August and October 2022.</p>
                    <p>The study has contacted 68 different stakeholders from a wide range of Gippsland industries and local municipalities of which 93% responded. The information collected has created the base of the study, most of which was anecdotal information
                        reported from senior members of the relevant stakeholders’ organisations.</p>
